**excerpts:** Almost a year ago, we published our now-annual landscape of machine intelligence companies, and goodness have we seen a lot of activity since then. As has been the case for the last couple of years, our fund still obsesses over `` problem first'' machine intelligence-- we've invested in 35 machine intelligence companies solving 35 meaningful problems in areas from security to recruiting to software development. At the same time, the hype around machine intelligence methods continues to grow: the words `` deep learning'' now equally represent a series of meaningful breakthroughs ( wonderful ) but also a hyped phrase like `` big data'' ( not so good! ). What's the biggest change in the last year?

**keywords:** last year, machine intelligence methods, meaningful problems, third more companies, software development, deep learning, machine intelligence, meaningful breakthroughs, now-annual landscape, different mix, machine intelligence companies, inbound inquiries, big data
