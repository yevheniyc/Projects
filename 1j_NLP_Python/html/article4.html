<p>Learning isn't a one-shot process: take the course, pass an exam, and get out. You learn by interacting with instructors and students, by assessing your progress, and using that to plan your next steps. It's an ongoing feedback loop that involves everyone in the classroom (whether the classroom is virtual or physical).</p>
<p>O'Reilly Media has always been a learning company. When we began to publish books in the mid-'80s, our editorial guidance for authors was to write as if they were a friend looking over the readers shoulder, providing wise and experienced advice.</p>
<p>In 2016, we're about much more than books. We've long had instructional video and conferences. In the past year, we've introduced live online training, in addition to live in-person training at conferences and other locations. But the same standard applies: we want the people who learn with us to feel like they have an expert looking over their shoulders and providing seasoned advice.</p>
<p>How do we do that? It starts with realizing that learning isn't just a one-way experience. When we analyzed conference attendance and early online courses, we saw that people participate as groups. <em>More than 50% attend our online courses as teams.</em> People don't attend courses as teams just so they can hang out together during breaks; they attend as teams so they can learn from each other, apply their new knowledge to their particular situation, and bring that knowledge back to their co-workers. When a team attends training, the group learns much more than sum of the individual experiences.</p>
