##NGL Examples
NGL 3D Viewer is used for interactive visualization of molecular structures (Peptide/DNA/RNA). It is based on WebGL technology and offers cross-browser compatibility. If your browser does not support WebGL, it might be a good time to upgrade your browser! NGL repo can be found [here](https://github.com/arose/ngl).

This repo is designed to provide detailed examples and documentation on the use of NGL's APIs.
