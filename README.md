# Python
Python example scripts, problem sets, bioinformatics tools, books, tutorials, and solutions with Jupyter.

##SocketIO
This script was written as a response to Wikipedia Research Engineering Team's challenge: https://github.com/halfak/research-engineering-task .

I handled their challenge with multithreading, but they insisted that multi-processing solution is what they desired. 

Handy script for using Multi-threading with Websockets and Python. I also included their proposed solution (Process_Changes.py), but my script can do more work in less time (arguably). 

##Notebook
Scripts written in Jupyter: 
  1. Data_Structures_and_Algorithms - follow Data Structures and Algorithms by Goodrich 
  2. Evercam_API_Test - testing and creating wrappers for Evercam APIs
  3. Parsing - a set of day-to-day parsing scripts
  4. Python_Cookbook_3 - follow Python Cookbook 3rd Edition

##GT_Computer_Networks
Assignments and projects for the Georgia Tech's Computer Networks 6250 Spring 2016 graduate course (OMSCS Program)
  1. Project_1 - Mininet, simple/complex network topologies, network simulation

##Game
A set of fun games developed with Python and CodeSkulptor for the Coursera's Interactive Programming with Python. 
Implemented basic concepts in mathematics, OOP and graphics to build interactive and dynamic games. Links are provided to "test" the games :)
  1. Pong - implementation of classic ping pong game (don't have too much fun!). Play [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user30_SsWb6yzDfo7EUyz.py)
    - Click on the play button to view game interface
    - Use keyboard arrows: player-1 ('up', 'down') and player-2 ('w', 's')
    - Ball movement will accelerate during the game!
  2. Blackjack - implementation of Blackjack. Please, I don't want you gambling issues on my conscience. Play [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user31_R8PVRLqskziSghE.py)
    - Click on the play button
  3. RiceRocks - spaceships, meteors, lasers, explosions, collisions, acceleration, powerful graphics - no more work for today! [Enjoy here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user33_6KEZdn2rEvmOGDF.py)
    - Click on the play button
    - Click "space bar" to shoot
    - Use keyboard arrows for movement

##Python_Cookbook_3
Testing scripts presented in the book with short summeries, using Jupyter.
