# Python
Python example scripts, problem sets, bioinformatics tools, books, tutorials, and solutions with Jupyter.

####SocketIO
This script was written as a response to Wikipedia Research Engineering Team's challenge: https://github.com/halfak/research-engineering-task .

I handled their challenge with multithreading, but they insisted that multi-processing solution is what they desired. 

Handy script for using Multi-threading with Websockets and Python. I also included their proposed solution (Process_Changes.py), but my script can do more work in less time (arguably).
