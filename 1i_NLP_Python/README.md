## Live Training - Natural Language Processing in Python
Practical techniques for preparing text for cutom search, content recommenders, AI applications, and more.

Python provides a number of awesome packages for natural language processing (NLP), along with great ways to leverage the results. This course is a great practical jump-start to NLP and will explore Deep Learning with the following topics:
- prep text for parsing
- extract key phrases
- prepare text for indexing in search
- calculate similarity between documents
- natural language generation
- chatbots
- ...and more

This is a great start for developing custom search, content recommenders, and even AI applications.

#### The approaches to use today
- Keyword analyis, n-grams, co-occurence, stemming, and other techniques from a previous generation of NLP tools are no longer the best approaches to use. 
- Whether NLP request Big Data tooling and use of clusters; instead, the course will show practical applications on a laptop. 
- That NLP work leading into AI applications is either fully automated or something which requires a huge amount of manual work; instead the course will demonstrate "human-in-the-loop" practices that make the best of both people skills and automation

####Benefits of using Python for NLP applications
- How statistical parsing works
- How resources such as [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) enhance text mining
- How to extract more than just a list of keywords from a text
- How to summarize and compare a set of documents
- How deep learning gets used with natural language

#### The course helped participants to
- Prepare texts for parsing - how to handle difficult Unicode
- Parse sentences into annotated lists, structured as JSON output
- Perform keyword randing using TF-IDF, while filtering stop words
- Calculate a Jaccard similarity measure to compare texts
- Leverage probabilistic data structures to perform the above more efficiently
- Use Jupyter notebooks for sharing all of the above within their teams
