## Assay Data Parsers

Data parsers for files generated from different types of assays:
  1. ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay):
    - data files are generated by a microplate reader from 96-well plates
  2. Softmax:
    - another microplate reader for ELISA assays that allows for more extensive
    data analysis for 96 and 384-well plates
  3. FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting):
    - data files are generated by different FACS machines and preprocessed with FlowJo. 
    - the output data files are parsed
  4. Biacore/Biacore4000
    - a molecular interaction analysis system for rapid screening and characterization.
    - the output plate data is parsed
  5. MSD:
    - Electrochemiluminescence detection system
    - the output plate data is parsed

Some of the machine-generated data is sometimes preprocessed with a specific software, i.e. FlowJo for FACS.
