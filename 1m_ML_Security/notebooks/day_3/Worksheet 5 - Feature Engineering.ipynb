    "\n",
    "This worksheet is a step-by-step guide on how to detect domains that were generated using \"Domain Generation Algorithm\" (DGA). We will walk you through the process of transforming raw domain strings to Machine Learning features and creating a decision tree classifer which you will use to determine whether a given domain is legit or not. Once you have implemented the classifier, the worksheet will walk you through evaluating your model.  \n",

    "Finally, let's tackle the **ngram** feature. There are multiple steps involved to derive this feature. Here in this notebook, we use an implementation outlined in the this academic paper [Schiavoni 2014: \"Phoenix: DGA-based Botnet Tracking and Intelligence\" - see section: Linguistic Features](http://s2lab.isg.rhul.ac.uk/papers/files/dimva2014.pdf).\n",

    "- **What are ngrams???** Imagine a string like 'facebook', if I were to derive all n-grams for n=2 (aka bi-grams) I would get '['fa', 'ac', 'ce', 'eb', 'bo', 'oo', 'ok']', so you see that you slide with one step from the left and just group 2 characters together each time, a tri-gram for 'facebook' would yielfd '['fac', 'ace', 'ceb', 'ebo', 'boo', 'ook']'. Ngrams have a long history in natural language processing, but are also used a lot for example in detecting malicious executable (raw byte ngrams in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have the 10000 most common english words (see data file we loaded, we call this DataFrame ```top_en_words``` in this notebook). Now we run the ```ngrams``` functions on a list of all these words. The output here is a list that contains ALL 1-grams, bi-grams and tri-grams of these 10000 most common english words.\n",
    "2. We use the ```Counter``` function from collections to derive a dictionary ```d``` that contains the counts of all unique 1-grams, bi-grams and tri-grams.\n",
    "3. Our ```ngram_feature``` function will do the core magic. It takes your domain as input, splits it into ngrams (n is a function parameter) and then looks up these ngrams in the english dictionary ```d``` we derived in step 2. Function returns the normalized sum of all ngrams that were contained in the english dictionary. For example, running ```ngram_feature('facebook', d, 2)``` will return 171.28 (this value is just like the one published in the Schiavoni paper).\n",
    "4. Finally ```average_ngram_feature``` wraps around ```ngram_feature```. You will use this function as your task is to derive a feature that gives the average of the ngram_feature for n=1,2 and 3. Input to this function should be a simple list with entries calling ```ngram_feature``` with n=1,2 and 3, hence a list of 3 ngram_feature results.   \n",
    "5. **YOUR TURN: Apply ```average_ngram_feature``` to you domain column in the DataFrame thereby adding ```ngram``` to the df.**\n",
    "6. **YOUR TURN: Finally drop the ```domain``` column from your DataFrame**.\n",
