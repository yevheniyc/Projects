*DISCLAIMER*: 
* Some parts of the repository came directly from the original [source][https://github.com/cgivre/data-science-for-security-professionals]. 
* I've modified it for personal educational purposes and use it as reference and guide. 
* The datasets were originally provided by the course repo. 
* The worksheets are completed by me!

### Resources

* *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart (http://amzn.to/2szqsUw) 
* *Python for Data Analysis* by Wes McKinney (http://amzn.to/2s03eKd)

### Required Software
Instructors provided an extremely helpful virtual machine! 
* Download and install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Download and unzip the Griffon virtual machine here: https://github.com/gtkcyber/griffon-vm  (You'll need 7-zip to unzip the VM)

If you are not using the VM, you will need to install Drill on your local machine. 

### Links
Drill supports a variety of NoSQL databases and file systems, including HBase, MongoDB, MapR-DB, HDFS, MapR-FS, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Swift, NAS and local files. A single query can join data from multiple datastores. For example, you can join a user profile collection in MongoDB with a directory of event logs in Hadoop.

Drill's datastore-aware optimizer automatically restructures a query plan to leverage the datastore's internal processing capabilities. In addition, Drill supports data locality, so it's a good idea to co-locate Drill and the datastore on the same nodes.

### Final Note
Many thanks to *Charles Givre* (the instructor of this course) for providing great resources and great learning material!
