#Phobos - Tandem Repeat Finder
Phobos is a command line application which produces a list of repeats that it found for a given
sequence. What your plugin needs to do is take a sequence from a Geneious document, pass
that to Phobos along with the appropriate command line parameters, and then parse the results
back and mark the identified repeats on the original sequence document. - Biomatters
